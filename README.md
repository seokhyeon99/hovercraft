## Arduino
1. Definition  
Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices.


2. Characteristic  
Its products are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License or the GNU General Public License, permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone.  
Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form or as do-it-yourself kits.  
Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers.  
The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards or breadboards and other circuits.  
The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus on some models, which are also used for loading programs from personal computers.  
The microcontrollers can be programmed using C and C++programming languages.  
In addition to using traditional compiler-tool-chains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment based on the Processing language project.
The Arduino project started in 2005 as a program for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Ivrea, Italy, aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators.  
Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats and motion detectors.  
The name Arduino comes from a bar in Ivrea, Italy, where some of the founders of the project used to meet.  
The bar was named after Arduin of Ivrea, who was the margrave of the March of Ivrea and King of Italy from 1002 to 1014.

## application using Thunkable  
1. Definition  
Thunkable is a web application integrated development environment.  
It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) very similar to the programming languages Scratch, which allows users to drag and drop visual objects to create an application that can run on mobile devices.

We set up the acceleration and deceleration buttons for each side.
If bluetooth is connected, we can select a device in List_Viewer screen.
